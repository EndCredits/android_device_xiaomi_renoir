    <!-- Some apps still use this dimen to size their layout. That is totally fine in theory
         because the framework links this dimen to status_bar_height_portrait by default. 
         The problem is that often times these apps do not take status_bar_padding_top into
         account, so as a result, their view is too high and cuts into the actual statusbar area.
         Deliberately give this dimen a value that is approximately status_bar_height_portrait +
         status_bar_padding_top in dp so that these apps can look normal again. -->
